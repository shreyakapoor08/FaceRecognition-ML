# FaceRecognition-ML
This project is build using the concept of KNN algorithm of Machine Learning. The system works by detecting the face of the person and recognise it's name.

I have used a pretrained model called harcasscade model it uses something called adaboost to select best feature out of many. It classify if given object is a face or not.
working on facedetection.py
now face_data.py
